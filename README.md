Useful resources:

  * conda env create -f aind-environment-osx.yml to create the environment.
  ( then source activate aind to enter the environment.
  * Install the development version of hmmlearn 0.2.1 with a source build: pip install git+https://github.com/hmmlearn/hmmlearn.git. If you are having trouble on this step feel free to skip ahead. You'll only need this for hmmlearn in the very last project.
